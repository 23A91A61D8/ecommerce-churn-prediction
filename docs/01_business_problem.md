# Business Problem Statement

## 1. Business Context
E-commerce companies generate large volumes of transactional data from customer purchases.
One of the major challenges in the e-commerce industry is customer churn, where customers stop
purchasing from the platform. Retaining existing customers is critical because acquiring a new
customer costs significantly more than retaining an existing one.

The business currently lacks a data-driven system to identify customers who are likely to churn
in the near future. This results in inefficient marketing campaigns and lost revenue opportunities.

## 2. Problem Definition
Customer churn is defined as a customer who has not made any purchase in the last 90 days.
The objective of this project is to predict which customers are likely to churn in the next
three months based on their historical transaction behavior.
