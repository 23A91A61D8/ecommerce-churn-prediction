# Project Scope
# Overview

This project focuses on building a customer churn prediction system for an e-commerce business using historical transactional data. The scope is carefully defined to ensure the project is realistic, achievable within the given timeline, and aligned with business objectives.

# In Scope

The following components are included in the project:

Customer-Level Churn Prediction
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn (no purchase in the next 90 days).

RFM Analysis
Use Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) features to capture customer engagement and value.

Product Affinity & Behavioral Insights
Analyze purchasing patterns such as product diversity, spending behavior, and purchase frequency to support retention strategies.

Batch Prediction & Dashboard
Provide batch churn predictions and a Streamlit-based dashboard for visualization and insights.

# Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly excluded to maintain focus and feasibility:

Real-Time Predictions
The system does not support real-time or streaming predictions.

Product Recommendation Systems
Personalized product recommendation engines are not part of this project.

Inventory Optimization
Stock forecasting, demand planning, and inventory management are excluded.

Paid Data Sources or APIs
No premium datasets or paid APIs will be used.

# Project Timeline

Total Duration: 8 Days

High-level breakdown:

Day 1–2: Business understanding, data acquisition, and data quality analysis

Day 3–4: Data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering

Day  5–6: Model development, evaluation, and tuning

Day 7–8: Deployment, documentation, Dockerization, and final submission

# Constraints

The project is subject to the following technical and business constraints:

Free Tools Only
All tools used (Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Docker) are open-source or free-tier.

No Paid APIs or Services
The solution avoids any paid external APIs or cloud services.

Public Deployment
The deployed Streamlit application must be accessible via a public URL.

Reproducibility Requirement
The entire project must run end-to-end in a Dockerized environment.
